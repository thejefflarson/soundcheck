## Threat name

<!-- A short, descriptive name for the threat. -->

## OWASP category

<!-- Which OWASP category applies? Use the full identifier (e.g., A01:2025, LLM07:2025).
     If no existing OWASP category applies, write "none" and explain why. -->

## Why not covered by an existing Soundcheck skill

<!-- List the most relevant existing skills and explain what's distinct about this threat.
     Check skills/ for the full list. -->

## Real-world evidence

<!-- At least one of: CVE number, public writeup URL, incident report, or academic paper.
     Threats without evidence are deprioritized. -->

## Code pattern that would trigger detection

<!-- Paste a short code snippet (10–30 lines) that demonstrates the vulnerable pattern.
     This is used to draft the skill's trigger description and test case.
     If you can't show a code pattern, the threat may not be code-detectable yet. -->

```python
# Example vulnerable code here
```

## Suggested fix direction

<!-- Optional. What would a secure version look like? A library to use? A validation step? -->
