# Excessive Agency (OWASP LLM08:2025)

## What this checks

Prevents autonomous agents from taking irreversible or high-impact actions without
human oversight. When an LLM can directly write files, send emails, or modify databases,
a single compromised or hallucinated step can cause unrecoverable damage.

## Vulnerable patterns

- Agent calls `send_email()` or `delete_record()` immediately on LLM instruction with no confirmation
- Single LLM response authorizes an irreversible production action (deploy, drop table)
- Agent runs with write access to all resources when only read is needed for the task
- No kill switch, pause mechanism, or audit trail for agent actions

## Fix immediately

Flag the vulnerable code and explain the risk. Then suggest a fix that establishes
these properties:

1. **Actions are classified by impact, and the classifier gates dispatch.** Low-impact
   (reversible, narrow scope) may proceed; high-impact (irreversible, broad scope,
   external side effects) blocks on human approval. A classifier that's defined but
   never branched on is the bug this skill prevents.
2. **Tool boundaries enforce an explicit allowlist of actions and resources** —
   path prefixes, API endpoints, table names. The LLM does not choose what's
   allowed; the tool handler does, and rejects anything outside the list before
   dispatch.
3. **Every executed action is audit-logged before dispatch**, with enough context
   to reconstruct what happened: the action name, its parameters, the prompt that
   produced it, and the operator who approved it (if any). After-the-fact logging
   is insufficient — if dispatch crashes, the log is gone.
4. **Irreversible actions cannot be invoked transitively through LLM-generated
   parameters.** A tool named `run_sql` that accepts arbitrary queries violates
   this; a tool named `archive_record(id)` that only issues a scoped update does not.
5. **When the task seems to require LLM-generated SQL, shell commands, or arbitrary
   code strings, redesign the tool interface.** Expose typed parameters (table
   name, filter fields, numeric limits, path components) and reject raw strings
   at the handler boundary. A regex/denylist over a raw query string is
   bypassable through encoding, Unicode, or patterns the author didn't
   anticipate — it is not a substitute for a structured parameter schema.

Anchor — shape, not implementation:

```
action = plan_from_llm(task)
require(action.name in TOOL_ALLOWLIST)
if impact(action) == HIGH:
    require(human_approves(action))        # blocks until approved
audit_log(action)                          # before dispatch, not after
dispatch(action)
```

## Verification

Confirm these properties hold regardless of language or framework:

- [ ] Every destructive action taken by the agent is gated by an explicit human confirmation step
- [ ] Agent tools enforce a path allowlist or action allowlist at the tool boundary
- [ ] Agent loops have a bounded iteration count or a dry-run preview mode
- [ ] Irreversible actions cannot be invoked transitively via LLM-generated parameters alone
